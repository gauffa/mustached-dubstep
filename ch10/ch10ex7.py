#Write a program that reads this file and creates a dictionary in which the keys
#are the names of the teams and each key's associated value is the number of times
#the team has won the World Series. The program should also create a dictionary
#in which the keys are the years and each key's associated value is the name of the
#team that won that year.

#The program should prompt the user for a year in the range of 1903 through 2009. It
#should then dispaly the name of team that won the World Series that year and the
#number of times that the teams has won the World Series.
