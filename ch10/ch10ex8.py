#Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as
#key-value pairs. The program should display a menu that lets the user look
#up a person's email address, add a new name and email address, change an
#existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address.
#The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file when the
#user exits the program. Each time the program starts it should retrieve
#the dictionary from the file and unpickle it.
